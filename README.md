# Web Eureka Server

This is my Eureka server which will work in unison with my Gateway API.
Their combine force gives me the best of both worlds.

- The gateway  acts as a single entry point for clients to interact with your microservices. 
It handles routing requests to the appropriate services based on the request path, method, 
or headers. The API Gateway can also provide additional functionalities such as request/response 
transformation, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, caching, and more.  


- Eureka's main role is to help microservices find and communicate with each other. 
It provides a central registry where services can register themselves when they come online 
and deregister when they go offline. Other services can then query Eureka to discover available 
instances of a particular service. Eureka also offers load balancing by distributing incoming 
requests among available instances of a service.

# Combining Eureka and the Gateway API

- When I use Eureka in combination with an API Gateway, I am creating a 
powerful system that takes advantage of both service discovery and routing capabilities. 
The API Gateway can use Eureka to dynamically discover the available services and route 
incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on the desired configuration. 
This allows me to create a more manageable and scalable architecture.
